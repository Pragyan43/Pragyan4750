# Creating our own token

This Solidity program is a program for creating our own token that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language. 

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has 2 functions, first is mint function that allows creating new tokens and another one is burn function that allows destroying existing tokens. This program can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.7;

contract MyToken {

    // public variables here
    string public tokenName = "PRAGYAN";
    string public tokenAbbry = "PRG";
    uint public totalSupply = 0;

    // mapping variable here
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    // mint function
    function mint (address _address, uint _value) public {
        totalSupply += _value;
        balances[_address] += _value;
    }

    // burn function
    function burn (address _address, uint _value) public {
        if (balances[_address] >= _value) {
            totalSupply -= _value;
            balances[_address] -= _value;
        }
    }

}

```

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.7" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile myToken.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "MyToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the mint and burn function. Click on the "MyToken" contract in the left-hand sidebar, and then click on the "mint" function and write the address (i.e address you can copy from account given above) and value. 
Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the function and click on totalSupply button to view the value you have given in mint value.
Similarly click on "burn" function and write the address (i.e address you can copy from account given above) and value. Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the function and click on totalSupply button to view the value you have given in burn value.
You can view the tokenName by clicking on the tokenName button which will return "PRAGYAN" and can view the tokenAbbry by clicking on the tokenAbbry button which will return "PRG".
